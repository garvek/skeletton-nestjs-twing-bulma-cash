# skeletton-nestjs-twing-bulma-cash
Skeletton for a basic application with NestJS, Twing, Bulma and Cash

Goal of this repository is to provide a base for anyone interrested in developping with the mentionned packages. This doesn't aim to be perfect neither the state of the art, but I hope it will give aid and clues if someone encounters issues when trying to use all these packages in the same project.

Pull requests are welcome, with the limitations to not change the purpose of the repository.

Current status is: basic page working, with some examples of template and javascript.

Future goals:
- update packages as new versions come
- improve integration, write cleaner code
- maybe add some basic modules often used with NestJS if the complexity is reasonnable
